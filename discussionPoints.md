* GET /registry APIs: 
  - Not GET /dp/ only, 
  - Why 3 APIs? (keep tags/id optional and fuse all the 3 APIs), 
  - what's userIdentifierType?, 
  - what's vocabulary for tags
* Simplify heartbeat API
* what's "X-fwd-to"? we decided to put destn's in the body
* consent artefact: 
  - expirtyTime? and in 2 places?
  - signature?
  - separate data from permission block
  - additionalParams??
